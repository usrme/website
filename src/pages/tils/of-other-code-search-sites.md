As an addendum to my praise of [GitHub's advanced search](https://usrme.xyz/tils/githubs-advanced-search-is-still-great/), I've come across additional sites where code can be searched[^1]. Namely:

* grep.app: [https://grep.app/](https://grep.app/ "https://grep.app/")
* Sourcegraph: [https://sourcegraph.com/search](https://sourcegraph.com/search "https://sourcegraph.com/search")
* Heline: [https://heline.dev/](https://heline.dev/ "https://heline.dev/")

The latter seems to be somewhat lacking in its results compared to the others, but could still be helpful in a pinch!

[^1]: I've now (21.07.22) discovered that there is a more extensive list of code search tools: https://codesearchguide.org/tools
