## Introduction

I am a 32-year-old guy who hails from Estonia and currently works in XYB as a Cloud DevOps engineer for the Infrastructure team. I’ve been working with a wide range of infrastructure for almost 10 years now and I absolutely love working with systems that bring joy to users, be it internal or external. When it comes to programming languages I’m very proficient in Bash, Python, and Go, but I won’t shy away from any new language! I’ve managed infrastructure with Chef, Ansible, and most often with Terraform. I tackle problems in a pragmatic way and truly enjoy it when a team comes together to solve a problem.
