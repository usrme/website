# Introduction

I am a 30-year-old guy who hails from Estonia and currently works in RangeForce as a DevSecOps engineer for the Infrastructure team. My day-to-day revolves around developing and maintaining an Azure-based infrastructure and writing internal tooling to better interact with Azure, and I couldn't be more happy with the combination! Below is a short overview of my past experiences.
