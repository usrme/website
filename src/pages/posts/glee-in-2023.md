## Few words

I considered leaving this section out completely as most of what has transpired this year has been of the personal kind, but rest assured, dear definitely existing reader, all is well and I'm not sure could even be better! A year to look back on, for sure, but a year that is making me excited for all that is to come.

## Recap

### Learning Kubernetes

After falling down the rabbit hole of learning about [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/) it became clear that my underlying knowledge of Kubernetes itself needs to be deeper and thus I started re-reading "Kubernetes: Up and Running" , along with new ones, such as "Core Kubernetes" and the "Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Guide" by Benjamin Muschko. The latter will hopefully serve me well in actually becoming a Certified Kubernetes Administrator as I've also took it upon myself to complete the certification sooner rather than later. I decided for the official certification route as I remember when I did my [LPIC-1](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview/) certification way back when, it actually taught me things that would have taken far longer to unearth on my own through day-to-day usage. I'm hoping the same will hold true for the CKA certification in 2024.

### Switching to (Neo)Vim

At one point during this summer, I completely switched away from Visual Studio Code over to using NeoVim as my editor of choice, and while it's difficult for me to quantify any increase or decrease in productivity, it is definitely a choice I do not regret! I was finally pushed over the line by [ThePrimeagen's "Vim As Your Editor" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) and [Dreams of Code's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtgo-nP_r8Y) on turning Vim into a fully featured IDE. It does take a lot more effort to properly configure your setup compared to Visual Studio Code so that all the magic-y bits like type hints and code refactorings work, to say nothing of learning the actual motions to navigate within Vim. Once you get through the initial slog that may take a couple of weeks, everything starts to feel like second nature, and I've personally really enjoyed that I can now far more comfortably carry myself both on my personal machine and on any machine I SSH into where Vi is most likely always present.

ThePrimeagen has recommended several times that since the NeoVim way of doing things does require configuring and tinkering, it's best not to fall into the trap of doing every bit of configuration right away, but to instead write down any annoyances or feature requests, if you will, that you may have and tackle them all at a later date. That is something I'm going to be doing going into the new year, as from time to time, there are some actions that I wish I had a better way of doing, and if I don't write them down and commit to learning them, I'll just keep on doing them in the semi-automatic way, which is far from ideal given all the power (Neo)Vim has.

## Books read

Down to 13 from 17, as compared to last year, but amongst those a handful really stood out to me (on top of [the one I already reviewed](https://usrme.xyz/posts/book-review-how-minds-change-by-david-mcraney/)) and I would happily recommend the following.

### "Immune" by Philipp Dettmer

Though I'm not one to buy YouTube-channel-specific merchandise, this book being authored by the originator of [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) piqued my curiosity immensely, as I could honestly say that the chosen topic—our immune system—was (and is still, to an extent) a mystery to me, something I desperately wanted to remedy. This is one of those books that, despite just being an introduction to the vastness of immunology, leaves you feeling like you've had a whole other world opened to you after reading it! It is absolutely awe-inspiring how well Philipp put pen to paper and how incredibly the digital artwork that so many people have come to know and love from Kurzgesagt was dutifully brought over to the physical world.

### "Determined" by Robert M. Sapolsky

I think the first time I came across not treating free will as a given was in the context of considering whether those who have been punished to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes should be given leniency, given that, in all likelihood, they have had a rough go of it from the moment they were conceived. To me, it's not out of this world to consider this, as it stands to reason that in one way or another, we are who we are because of all the big and small moments that have led up to this very point; some have just had the misfortune to constantly be in the throes of both the micro and the macro. The author sheds light on what the micro and macro really entail and the current science behind it, and while it may sting to consider yourself less of the autonomous being you think you are, it's humbling on a more grand scale, and I honestly believe it will change the way you see the world.

### "The Lincoln Highway" by Amor Towles

I mentioned [last year](https://usrme.xyz/posts/hullabaloo-with-2022/#books-read) that after reading "A Gentleman in Moscow," I bought his other books as well: "Rules of Civility" and "The Lincoln Highway." I read the former first, and while Amor's way of captivating the reader is still strong, it wasn't anywhere near enough of a page-turner (for me) as "A Gentleman in Moscow" was. Maybe that's to be expected given that "Rules of Civility" was his first publication. His latest might just top all his previous books in my eyes. Instead of the story taking place over several years, decades even, this one unwinds its spool of literary genius over the course of just 10 days, which seems all the more amazing given that the physical book is thicker than an encyclopedia! I just could not stop reading one more chapter, and for a work of fiction, any book really, that has to be worth something. Here's to hoping his next one won't take five years to produce!
