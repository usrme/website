## Books read

Down to 13 from 17, as compared to last year, but amongst those a handful really stood out to me (on top of [the one I already reviewed](https://usrme.xyz/posts/book-review-how-minds-change-by-david-mcraney/)) and I would happily recommend the following.

### "Immune" by Philipp Dettmer

Though I'm not one to buy YouTube-channel-specific merchandise, this book being authored by the originator of [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) piqued my curiosity immensely as I could honestly say that the topic that was chosen—our immune system—was (and is still, to an extent) a mystery to me; something I desperately wanted to remedy. This is one of those books that despite just being an introduction to the vastness of immunology, you come away after reading it like you've just had a whole other world opened to you! It is absolutely awe-inspiring how well Philipp put pen to paper and how incredibly the digital artwork that so many people have come to know and love from Kurzgesagt was dutifully brought over to the physical world.

### "Determined" by Robert M. Sapolsky



### "The Lincoln Highway" by Amor Towles

I mentioned [last year](https://usrme.xyz/posts/hullabaloo-with-2022/#books-read) that after reading "A Gentleman in Moscow" I bought his other books as well: "Rules of Civility" and "The Lincoln Highway". I read the former first and while Amor's way of captivating the reader is still strong, it wasn't nowhere enough of a page-turner (for me) as "The Gentleman in Moscow" was. Maybe that's to be expected given that "Rules of Civility" was his first publication. His latest might just top all his previous books in my eyes. Instead of the story taking place over several years, decades even, this one unwinds its spool of literary genius over the course of just 10 days, which seems all the more amazing given that the physical book is thicker than an encyclopedia! I just could not stop reading one more chapter and for a work of fiction, any book really, that has to be worth something. Here's to hoping his next one won't take five years to produce!
