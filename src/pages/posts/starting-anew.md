title: Starting anew
tags: ["thoughts"]

There's always been a fascination for me with the idea of a blog where I jot down the thoughts that come into my head, and for whatever egotistical reason I have fancied myself a good writer, so the blog that has been in my head has been fantastic! There have been attempts in the past where I've played with the idea by keeping a sort of travel blog, but that quickly fell by the wayside.

I can't actually recall why exactly, but I would assume it's why most attempts to **start anew** fail: the idea of it has been built up in our heads and any attempts to live up to it fall short due to not having experience with it.

My idea is to make writings here a regular affair focusing mostly on thoughts related to development and engineering with a healthy mix of (short) guides on more technical topics that have been invaluable to me.

In the essence of Max BÃ¶ck's [Good Enough](https://mxb.dev/blog/good-enough/) I will just go ahead a publish this as it is as I can already feel the urge of perfectionism coming on and if I don't do it now then Voltaire's aphorism would ring true once more:

> Perfect is the enemy of good
